        <h1>Reflections of a Web Developer Wannabe - My answers to the Fireside Questions</h1>

         <h3><em>Question One: What is your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</em> </h3>
          <p>
            Answer: Pretty full on up front, there is a lot to remember and take in. With the various bookmarks, apps and links one could be forgiven for getting lost.
            I have asked poor Harrison and Jack so many questions feeling somewhat unsure how to proceed, but I have in many circumstances found the answers for myself 
            very quickly found the answer to the myself the more I explore.
            Having had some exposure to code some of the programming and coding practices in the past I have found this somewhat beneficial.</p>
  
        <h3><em>Question: What are your impressions?</em></p>
          <p>Answer: I love how open everyone is, and am very impressed with how the Dev Academy has embraced diversity. And the IKE - Integrity, Kindness, Effort.</p>

        <h3><em>Question:Have your expectations of EDA changed? </em></h3>
