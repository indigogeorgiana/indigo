    <h2> Time and Habit Techniques:</h2>
       
      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>The pormodoro, I chose that method because U wanted to see what I could achieve without the interruption of family. Also I wanted to see if my mind with drift while I was engaged with reading some the of the information put before us in the this sprint.</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>What I found interesting is one, I should always study on a Monday to Friday while the children are at school. Two that my mind didn't feel as inundated with code or all the stresses and I could quiet my mind and focus at the one task at hand. I felt a little more clearer and restful and not so stressed about completing this sprint. I knew that I would complete it.</p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>What worked for me while I was reading through the various pieces of information I found the articles or writing on the habits of successful the idea of start small. Suddenly a light went one. I had started this cohort with sixteen weeks under my sleeve. I also realised that I had plenty of time to complete these tasks before me, so I step back for a few days always remembering and thinking about the questions of this very task. Formulating an approach as soon as Monday came about.</p>
   <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3> 
        <p>I would defintely like to attempt meditation, reading through the information I also had never knew about the benefits.  It taught me alot about myself my strengths and weaknesses, I like the idea having a mind of clarity in todays world and as a mother of three is easy to forget the importance of sanity, unplugging and taking time for yourself.  I also liked the youtube video about forget big change, start with a tiny habit. Ten different ways to celebrate, the energy and the ideolgy of the presenter and the message he was trying to convey. </p>
