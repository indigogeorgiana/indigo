          <head3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</head3>
          <p>Pormodoro sounded quiet promising because I wanted to see what I could achieve without the distractions or interuptions from family members. So I decided to treat the next 30 mins like a experiment to find out if my mind would drift or lose focus engaged with the amount of reading and information put before us in the this sprint.</p>
     
          <head3>What did you find interesting?</head3>
          <p>What I found interesting is one, I should always study on a Monday to Friday while the children are at school. Two that my mind didn't feel as inundated with code or all the stresses and I could quiet my mind and focus at the one task at hand. I felt a little more clearer and restful and not so stressed about completing this sprint. I knew that I would complete it.</p>
      
          <head3>What worked for you?</head3>
          <p>While Reading through the various pieces of information I found the articles on the habits of successful the idea of starting small. Luckily, having started this cohort with 8 extra weeks up my sleeve this allowed me plenty of time to really focus and concentrate unhurriedly on the tasks before me. I have found personally steping back from study for a few days has helped me alot. Moving forward on the following Monday I quickly formulated my future approach on Phase zero.</p>
      
          <head3>Which will you experiment further with?</head3> 
          <p>I would defintely like to attempt meditation, reading through the information I also had never knew about the benefits.  It taught me alot about myself my strengths and weaknesses, I like the idea having a mind of clarity in todays world and as a mother of three is easy to forget the importance of sanity, unplugging and taking time for yourself.  I also liked the youtube video about forget big change, start with a tiny habit. Ten different ways to celebrate, the energy and the ideolgy of the presenter and the message he was trying to convey. </p>
