             <div class="h2">How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</div>
             <li><p>HTML - Which means hypertext Mark up Language is a markup language used for creating web pages/websites.</p></li>
             <li><p>CSS - Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of web pages on the internet. CSS can be used to define text syles, table sizes and other aspects of webpages.</p></li>
             <li><p>DOM - The document object model is an application programming interface that html and xml code is designed within. </p></li>
                       

        <div class="h2">My analogy, building a website is just like building a house. </div>
        
        <p>For anyone who has ever built a house they would likely tell you that the above statement is not entirely true, but in principal the basics of building a home are similar.<p <p>Firstly, Think of the DOM our foundation in this analogy, for without a reliable strudy DOM (concrete foundation) construction of a website simply is not possible</p> 
              <p> Secondly, a get Web Developer or team of developers depending on the size of your project. </p>
              <p> Thirdly,They will use another key element HTML, yes hyper text markup language its otherwise known as to start building.</p> 
              <p>Lastly, CSS which will be our design element, with which crisp and colourful images, fonts and other design elements can be used to make our website/house looks all snazzy. </p>
             
             
              <div class="h2">What is meant by boxifying design?</div>
              <p>Given that all elements needed to design a webpage can fit into boxes, as web developer's we are able to define and divde these elemnts within the box model. Content, Borders, margins and </p>
              
              <div class="h2">What is the box model?</div>
              <ul><li><p>Simply put boxifying design is a method of taking everything needed to build a webpage and dividing these four elements into various boxes. </p></li></ul>  
              <ul><li><p>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent </p></li></ul>
              <ul><li><p>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.</p></li></ul>
              <ul><li><p>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent </p></li></ul>
              <ul><li><p>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.</p></li></ul>
