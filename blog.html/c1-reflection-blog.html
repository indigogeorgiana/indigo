               <ol><ul>Pretty full on up front, there is a lot to remember and take in. With the various bookmarks, apps and links one could be forgiven for getting lost.
              I have asked poor Harrison and Jack so many questions feeling somewhat unsure how to proceed, but I have in many circumstances found the answers for myself 
              very quickly found the answer to the myself the more I explore.
              Having had some exposure to code some of the programming and coding practices in the past I have found this somewhat beneficial.</ul></ol>
