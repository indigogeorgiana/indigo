              <div class="header3">What is your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</div>
                <div class="header4">Pretty full on up front, there is a lot to remember and take in. With the various bookmarks, apps and links one could be forgiven for getting lost.
                   I have asked poor Harrison and Jack so many questions feeling somewhat unsure how to proceed, but I have in many circumstances found the answers for myself 
                    very quickly found the answer to the myself the more I explore. Having had some exposure to code some of the programming and coding practices in the past I have found this somewhat beneficial.</div>
                <div class="header3">What are your impressions?</div>
                <div class="header4">I love how open everyone is, and am very impressed with how the Dev Academy has embraced diversity. And the IKE - Integrity, Kindness, Effort.</div>
        
                <div class="header3">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</div>
                <div class="header4">To know that my study and work environment is going to be engaging, open and regardless of any of my own fears I will be working with an awesome bunch of people.</div>
         
                <div class="header3">Have your expectations of EDA changed?</div>
                <div class="header4">No serverely no. If so, how?</div>
         
                <div class="header3">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</div>
                <div class="header4">Definitely will be a challenge.</div>
      
                <div class="header3">Does it make you nervous?</div>
